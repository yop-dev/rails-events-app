- Updates existing events with blank descriptions to "Event description to be updated."

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Field-level error messages appear directly under each input

- ✅ Custom validation messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Both browser-side (HTML5) and server-side validation

### Form Validation Features
- **Name**: Required field with validation error display
- **Date**: Required field with validation error display  
- **Location**: Required field with validation error display
- **Description**: Now required field with validation error display

### Technical Details
- Model validation: `validates :description, presence: { message: "Please provide a description for your event" }`
- Form field: Added `required: true` attribute and error styling
- CSS: Added `.field-error` and `.field-error-message` classes for visual feedback

This ensures all events have meaningful descriptions while providing clear feedback to users when validation fails.
